## Java

Java is a language/platform maintained by Oracle. It’s known for it’s “Write-Once-Run-Anywhere” mantra and, in my opinion, for its verbosity.

## Kotlin

Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically-typed language that often targets the JVM. It’s used for web development, Android development, and much more.

## Android

Android is a mobile operating system designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Development is done predominantly in Kotlin or Java.

## Clojure

Clojure is a modern, dynamic, and functional dialect of the Lisp programming language that can be built to target many platforms, although predominantly the JVM or JavaScript.
