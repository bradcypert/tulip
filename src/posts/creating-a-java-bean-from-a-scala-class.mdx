Sometimes, you may find yourself in a situation (like using Scala with Spring) where you need to generate a Java bean but would like to do that in Scala. By default, Scala classes donâ€™t adhere to the requirements of the Bean definition, namely autogenerating getters and setters. Thankfully, there is a **BeanProperty** decorator that can be used in conjunction with the constructor definition to help adhere to the Bean specification.

You can start using it by importing the BeanProperty like so:

```
import scala.reflect.BeanProperty
```

Then in your class definition, you can use the decorator on your member fields to autogenerate the appropriate getters and setters to adhere to the Bean specification.

```

case class Car(@BeanProperty var color: ColorDefinition,
               @BeanProperty var size: CarSize,
               @BeanProperty var owner: String) {}

```

<script async="" src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>{" "}

<ins
  class="adsbygoogle"
  data-ad-client="ca-pub-8945603214034079"
  data-ad-format="fluid"
  data-ad-layout="in-article"
  data-ad-slot="2376037128"
  style="display: block; text-align: center;"
></ins>
<script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script>

Alternatively, you can annotate the class fields instead of the constructor fields.

```

class Car {
  @BeanProperty var color: ColorDefinition = null
  @BeanProperty var size: CarSize = CarSize.SEDAN
  @BeanProperty var owner: String = null
}

```

Either of theses styles of applying the decorators will work for you!
