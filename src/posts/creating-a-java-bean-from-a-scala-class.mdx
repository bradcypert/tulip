Sometimes, you may find yourself in a situation (like using Scala with Spring) where you need to generate a Java bean but would like to do that in Scala. By default, Scala classes donâ€™t adhere to the requirements of the Bean definition, namely autogenerating getters and setters. Thankfully, there is a **BeanProperty** decorator that can be used in conjunction with the constructor definition to help adhere to the Bean specification.

You can start using it by importing the BeanProperty like so:

```scala
import scala.reflect.BeanProperty
```

Then in your class definition, you can use the decorator on your member fields to autogenerate the appropriate getters and setters to adhere to the Bean specification.

```scala
case class Car(@BeanProperty var color: ColorDefinition,
               @BeanProperty var size: CarSize,
               @BeanProperty var owner: String) {}
```

Alternatively, you can annotate the class fields instead of the constructor fields.

```scala
class Car {
  @BeanProperty var color: ColorDefinition = null
  @BeanProperty var size: CarSize = CarSize.SEDAN
  @BeanProperty var owner: String = null
}
```

Either of theses styles of applying the decorators will work for you!
