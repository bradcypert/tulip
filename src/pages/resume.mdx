### Cool Things I’ve Worked On

**[Luna Journal](https://www.lunajournal.app)** **•** I've built Luna Journal from the ground up using Flutter, Dart and Firebase. There's a small amount of PHP and Wordpress work done for the marketing site, but the majority of this project is built with Flutter and Dart.

**[Linkedin Campaign Manager](http://linkedin.com/ad/accounts)** **•** Worked with a team of twelve to completely overhaul the existing campaign manager to bring up to speed with LinkedIn design principles. During my time on the team, test coverage increase two-fold.

**Timebeard** **•** A SaaS centered around virtualizing time capsules. Developed and designed the entire thing from scratch. Tech Stack: Meteorjs, Material Design, SASS.

**[myCarfax.com](http://www.mycarfax.com)** **•** Worked with a team of 5 to create AngularJS Applications and RESTful services in grails to power the website and it’s respective mobile applications.

**[CarfaxOnline.com](http://www.carfaxonline.com)** **•** Worked with a team of 7 to create an online portal for dealers to access all of the benefits that CARFAX can offer them. The app is written in Grails and it’s powered by several batch applications.

**Nissan’s Pre-owned Certification Process** **•** Nissan’s Pre-owned certification process was a Grails Application that integrates tightly with CARFAX to check the history of vehicles before certifying it as a Nissan Certified Pre-owned Vehicle.

**Porios** **•** A social network aimed at connecting people with podcasts and people with other people who share similar podcast interested. The backend is written entirely in Clojure (Ring webserver) leveraging Compojure routing, JWT authentication, and a Postgres DB. The frontend is an Angular2 typescript SPA.

### Conference Talks

**KC/DC – June 2015** – There are dozens of JavaScript server-side frameworks (Express, Sail.js, Total.js) but none of them give you the full-fledged integration with the client-side like Meteor.js. Due to this, I believe Meteor.js is the best solution for the standard SPA that needs a supporting database and hopefully, by the end of this session, you’ll be a believer too. Feel free to bring a laptop and follow along as we’ll cover building a basic meteor application during the session, if time permits.
