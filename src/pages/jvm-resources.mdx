# JVM Resources

## Java

Java is a language/platform maintained by Oracle. It’s known for it’s “Write-Once-Run-Anywhere” mantra and, in my opinion, for its verbosity.

- [How to use Java’s Enums](/a-beginners-guide-to-java-enums/)
- [The Builder Design Pattern](/design-patterns-builder/)
- [Reflection ](/intro-to-reflection-in-java/)

## Kotlin

Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically-typed language that often targets the JVM. It’s used for web development, Android development, and much more.

- [Dependency Injection via The Facade Pattern](/the-facade-pattern-for-simple-dependency-injection/)
- [Controllers in the KTOR web framework](/controllers-in-ktor/)
- [Testing via Expekt](/bdd-assertions-expekt-kotlin/)

- [Kotlin Sequences](/sequence-a-kotlin-type/)
- [Sealed Classes](/kotlin-sealed-classes/)
- [Testing Companion Objects](/static-methods-companion-objects-and-testing/)

## Android

Android is a mobile operating system designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Development is done predominantly in Kotlin or Java.

- [SurfaceFlinger](/what-is-androids-surfaceflinger/)
- [Testing views via FormatterObjects](/formatter-objects-testable-fragments/)
- [What is Proguard?](/what-the-heck-is-androids-proguard/)
- [Overriding Button Styles](/overriding-button-styles-in-android/)

- [When to use a Dimensions file](/the-complete-guide-to-dimensions-in-android/)
- [Using Butterknife with Kotlin](/using-butterknife-kotlin/)
- [Pending Intents](/android-pending-intents/)
- [ListView/RecyclerView](/android-listview-recyclerview-adapters/)

## Clojure

Clojure is a modern, dynamic, and functional dialect of the Lisp programming language that can be built to target many platforms, although predominantly the JVM or JavaScript.

- [Futures in Clojure](/using-futures-in-clojure/)
- [Intro to Async Programming](/clojure-async/)
- [Guide to Clojure.Spec](/an-informal-guide-to-clojure-spec/)
- [Provisioning a Clojure VM](/provisioning-a-development-environment-for-clojure-web-services-via-ansible-and-vagrant/)
- [Map vs PMap](/understanding-clojures-map-pmap/)
- [Linting with Kibit and Eastwood](/clojure-kibit-eastwood/)
- [The Thread Macro (-&gt;) ](/threading-pipelines-in-clojure/)
- [Multimethods](/mighty-morphing-multimethods/)
- [JSON Web Tokens](/using-json-web-tokens-with-clojure/)
- [Macros](/understanding-clojure-macros/)
- [Postgres + YeSQL Trigram Search](/adding-trigram-searching-to-a-clojure-webapp/)

## Scala

Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming in one concise, high-level language. **Note: Most of these examples will be using Scala 2.X**

- [Pagination with Slick](/a-quick-script-to-update-all-of-your-npm-dependencies/)
- [Creating a Java Bean from a Scala class](/creating-a-java-bean-from-a-scala-class/)
- [Scheduling background tasks in Play](/scheduling-background-jobs-in-play-with-scala/)
- [Upper/Lower Bounds in Scala](/upper-and-lower-bounds-in-scala/)
- [Generics in Scala](/using-generics-in-scala/)
