Hey there! I’ll keep this brief, as all of the good content for this post is audio.

Yesterday, I worked with a close friend of mine to release our first episode of the Design Doc podcast. That’s the podcast where I dig into questions about personal projects from experienced Software Engineers and we talk through some of the choices they’ve made, issues they’ve run into, and more.

You can find Design Doc anywhere podcasts are found (if you can’t, please let me know and ill work to get it listed on your favorite platform), but I also have [an Anchor.fm page](https://anchor.fm/design-doc), where can you send in prerecorded questions, feedback, shoutouts or whatever and I can feature them in future episodes.

If you’re interested in listening to the first episode of the first season, you can do so below!
