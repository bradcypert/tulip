### Conference Talks

**KC/DC – June 2015** – There are dozens of JavaScript server-side frameworks (Express, Sail.js, Total.js) but none of them give you the full-fledged integration with the client-side like Meteor.js. Due to this, I believe Meteor.js is the best solution for the standard SPA that needs a supporting database and hopefully, by the end of this session, you’ll be a believer too. Feel free to bring a laptop and follow along as we’ll cover building a basic meteor application during the session, if time permits.
